# BackTo1815
The Legend of Zelda: A Meme to the Past, the only web browser plugin a Dutch person will ever need.

## About
This is one of those projects that took 5 minutes to make, it simply uses a small JavaScript file to replace 'Belgium' with 'South-Netherlands'.

It should work with Firefox, Chrome and Chrome-based browsers.

If you are a Belgian and feel offended by this, I'm from Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, which is basically Belgium too.
